Iroh is a protocol for syncing & moving bytes. Bytes of any size, on any device. At its core, it's a peer-2-peer network built on a _magic socket_ that establishes [QUIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC) connections between peers. Peers request and provide _blobs_ of opaque bytes that are incrementally verified by their BLAKE3 hash during transfer.

## Using Iroh

Iroh is delivered as a Rust library and a CLI.

### Library

Run `cargo add iroh`, to add `iroh` to your project.

### CLI

Check out https://iroh.computer/docs/install to get started.

The implementation lives in the `iroh-cli` crate.
